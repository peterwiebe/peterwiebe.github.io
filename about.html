      <h1>My background</h1>

      <h2>Where I am from</h2>
      <p>I am from Vancouver, Canada. I have lived in and around the city my entire life. Having played in competitive sports, I have travelled the region fairly extensively. I always say that you could blindfold me and drop me off anywhere in the region and I could find my way home without asking for directions (or using any navigational device).</p>
      <h2>My interest/hobbies</h2>
      <p>The list is fairly long, I have had a passion for ice hockey from an early age but have played many sports of the years at competitive levels. I have always had a large interest in technology and computers. I can remember the first computer that my parents brought home and would spend countless hours playing around with it. I really enjoy gardening and growing plants; while I was studying at the University of British Columbia I built a window farm and had tomato plants growing in my apartment window for over a year. I have a soft spot for photography, while in high school I took a photography class and got to develop film in our schools dark room, then transfer the negatives to photopaper and develop the pictures in the specific chemical baths. I am just starting to learn about arduinos and micro controllers and am looking forward to building my own electronic devices. I am a gamer at heart, whether its board games or computer games I could spend hours competing against others, strategizing and figuring out ways to win. I love to learn, as I have grown older I have realized how much I like to continuously expand my knowledge. I could get into more specifics but I think I will leave it at that for now.</p>
      <h2>My educational background</h2>
      <p>After completing my high school degree I took some time off from school to work and get a better grasp of what I wanted in life. I found a fit in the business world and then went back to school at a community college to start my reentry into school. After two years of courses at Langara I transfered to the University of British Columbia to finish my Bachelors of Commerce. During the course of my education I had to take electives that were outside of the business faculty and so a lot of the courses I took were in computer science which helped me to get a grasp of object oriented concepts, logic and algorithms, programming languages, and electronics. I also took a few agriculture courses to better understand how plants function. One of the courses required us to spend a fair bit of time in the school green house and the school farm.</p>
      <h2>Something quirky about me</h2>
      <p>One of the things that I am really passionate about is health. My wife's health has become very ppor, to the point of where her doctor has told her to quit her job and spend all day in bed. To help combat her symptoms we have started to go to sensory deprivation chambers to "float". 'Floating' has been one of the most incredible activities that I have ever experienced. If you have not heard of 'floating' before the experience is as close to floating in space as gets while being on the ground (not that I have been in space or anything). 'Floating' consists of laying down in a sound-proof tank that holds about 10 inches of water that contains approximately 900 lbs of dissolved epsom salt, making you very boyant. The water is heated to the same temperature as your skin so it is hard to tell the difference between where your skin ends and the water begins, the air is purified to remove any scent, and being in a sound proof chamber means it is completely dark. Essentially, you are removed from all possible stimuli and are left with just your brain and your beating heart. One of the times that I went floating I managed to reach a level of relaxation that I had never felt before. My consciousness awoke but my physical self did not, I actually panicked in that moment, without a word of a lie I thought I was paralyzed. I could not feel any part of my body and could not command any part of it. I consciously tried to lift my leg or move my toes but could not make it so. After a little while I felt sensation slowly trickle back into my limbs, it was if I could feel all the blood cells slowly trickle back into my limbs and bring them to life. It was the most unreal sensation. From that point on I have tried to achieve that level of relaxation but have not been successful. My plan is to one day own a float tank and use it for meditative and restorative purposes to achieve this new level of being.</p>
