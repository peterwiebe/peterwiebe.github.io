      <h1>Enumerable Method: <code>each_slice</code></h1>
      <h2>A closer look at this enumerable method</h2>

        <h3>What is the <code>each_slice</code>?</h3>
        <p>
          each_slice is an enumerable method that takes an enumerable and yields a number of elements in the enumerable to be operated in the following block of code.
        </p>
        <p>
          An example given from the ruby docs:<br>
          <code>
            (1..10).each_slice(3) { |a| p a } <br>
            # outputs below <br>
            [1, 2, 3] <br>
            [4, 5, 6] <br>
            [7, 8, 9] <br>
            [10]
          </code>
        </p>
        <h3>Why should you use <code>each_slice</code>?</h3>
        <p>
          The Enumerable class is inherited by arrays, hashes, ranges, sets - all of which contain a collection of objects in them, sometimes all of those objects are all the same, sometimes they are different but have a certain pattern to them. You would want to use the slice to work on a group of the items in the collection at one time.
        </p>
        <h3>When should you use <code>each_slice</code>?</h3>
        <p>
          Imagine for a second that you have an array of people's names. You want to create a new array with arrays of groups of those names. The initial single dimension array could be parsed through with the <code>each_slice</code> method with the number of people you want to have in your groups and then in the code block that follows you could push that group into a new array called groups.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another situation could be that you know that the data returned in a collection object has a certain structure in a certain order. The order could be a name, a phone number, and an email. Knowing that, you could use each_slice(3) to look through your enumerable data, 3 elements at a time and add them to your page or into your database.
        </p>

          <code>each_slice</code> saved my bacon challenge 5.6 this week and it could save yours in the future. Have fun testing it out! --> You can see the offical docs here: <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.3/Enumerable.html#method-i-each_slice">http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.3/Enumerable.html#method-i-each_slice</a>
