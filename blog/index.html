  - How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

  Of all of the pairing challenges I have done thus far, this was the most challenging yet. You need to be very specific for syntax corrections and it can be challenging to explain concepts about structure of a website when the other person is not in the same space as you.


  - Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

  Normally I don't wireframe as part of my process but as we did it for this challenge I could see how it will be useful to do. I think it is a good idea to sketch out the basic layout even if it adds time to the process. It helps on the coding aspect and gives a frame of reference for the design.

  - What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

  We decided to keep it simple. Some of the resources have shown some more detail in the wireframes through shading and text. We just did the outlines of all the different elements.

  - What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

  I didn't learn about any new elements but we used nav and footer for our navigation menu and the footer at the bottom.
