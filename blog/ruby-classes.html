        <p>Hi everyone! This blog post will take you inside the world of classes in ruby. You can think of Classes as the definitions to the objects that you create when you create your programs. Classes give objects their own set of variables called instance variables and their own set of methods to interact with the objects.</p>
        <p>When developing a program you will tend to want to model real world objects. You will want the computer version of those objects to have specific characteristics and specific functions, these are the instance variables and methods that I spoke about earlier! Let's use a car as an example.</p>
        <p>When we think of a car and what makes up a car's characteristics we usually identify them as being by made by a certain manufacturer, being a certain model type, we identify the year the car was made, and many more characteristics. A car will also have many different functions when you think about it, the gas pedal makes the car move forward (if there is gas in the car), the brake slows the car down to a stop, you can press the power button on the stereo to listen to music, and it goes on! These are all examples of the variables and methods that could be used inside of a class called car. Let's define one now:</p>
        <p>To start off with lets just define an empty car class, you do so with the following example:</p>
        <code>class Car <br><br>end</code>
        <p>So we start off with the keyword class followed by the name of the class we want to use (Capitalized) and then make sure to put the end statement when we are done defining the class.</p>
        <p>Next up, when we want to create a car object we will generally want to give it some values to identify it compared to the other cars (the manufacturer, model, year, etc. I mentioned earlier). To do so we can create the initialize method with arguments that will be passed in:</p>
        <code>class Car
          <br>
          <br>def initialize(manufacturer, model, year)
          <br>@manufacturer = manufacturer
          <br>@model = model
          <br>@year = year
          <br>
          <br>end</code>
          <p>As you can see above, when we create a new instance of a class the manufacturer, model, and year information are passed in as arguments in the initialize method and then the "instance variables" for the class are set to those values. Instance variables are a different kind of variable, first of all they start with an @ and secondly, once they are defined in the class they can be accessed anywhere else in the class - this makes them very handy!</p>
          <p>Next lets look at instance methods. Instance methods are just like regular methods and they look the same too. We can define them just as we would before:</p>
          <code>class Car
          <br>
          <br>def initialize(manufacturer, model, year)
          <br>@manufacturer = manufacturer
          <br>@model = model
          <br>@year = year
          <br>
          <br>def get_year
          <br>@year
          <br>end
          <br>
          <br>end</code>
          <p>So in the above we have defined the method get_year, it doesn't need to be passed any variables because it can access the instance variables explicity when defined earlier. This function just returns the value that was in the get_year when called on the object that you already created. There are more advanced shortcuts to accessing and writing to the instance variables that we can use but I will save that for another time.</p>
