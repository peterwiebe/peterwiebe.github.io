  <h1>Version Control and Git</h1>
  <h2>The benefits, how it tracks changes, and why use GitHub?</h2>

    <h3>What are the benefits of version control?</h3>
    <p>
      Imagine that you are writing an essay, a report, or a very long email. You have spent hours of work, you have made dozens of revisions, and you have had others edit the work all along the way. Upon doing further research into the topic that you are writing about you realize that some new information completely invalidates some of the most recent changes that you made to your work. How are you going to go back to an earlier version of your file without nuking the whole thing and starting over? Keep in mind, you have been working on this for more than one day and hitting Ctrl Z or Command Z isn't going to take you back. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This is where version control comes in handy. Every time you hit Ctrl S or Command S to save your work, much more is happening than overwriting the original file with the newest changes. In version control that one save point is one point of the many that you can return to should you need to go back to it - the ultimate undo function. It stores information like who made the change, when the change was made, and why the change was made.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the project expands in size this becomes very useful because there may be numerous people all working off the same project at the same time, on the same files. I wouldn't want to be the person to tell everyone that was working on the project that all the work they have been doing has to be deleted and they need to start over. make sure to use version control!
    </p>
    <h3>How does git help you keep track of your changes?</h3>
    <p>
      Git helps you to keep track of changes when you 'commit' those changes to the local repository using <code>git commit -m "custom message here"</code>. This is a specific command that you use when you are ready to save the changes that you made to the project you are working on. When you make the commit, this is when all of the information I wrote about earlier are saved. After making several commits to the project you can use <code>git log</code> in the bash shell to see all of the commits you made their information. Once you are satisfied with what you have contributed you push all of your commits to the repository on GitHub.
    </p>
    <h3>Why use GitHub to store your code?</h3>
    <p>
      GitHub is a great place to store your code because it is a centralized location where anyone who is working on the same project as you can get a copy from and upload their changes to.   Over time GitHub has evolved to add many useful features to help teams be more productive and efficient with their projects.  
    </p>
    <p>
      To write code you don't need to have an internet connection but when you have a team working on a project you need to have a place where everyone can access the most recent version of the project at any given time.
    </p>
    <p>
      A distributed version control system (which I won't get into here) doesn't require a single place but not everyone may be working from the most recent master version which could lead to more problems down the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also the most common repository site used today so you will probably want to get familiar with it should you want to work with any company or on any future projects.
