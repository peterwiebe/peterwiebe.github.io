      <h1>Big O Notation</h1>
      <h2>An important concept to keep in mind when developing programs</h2>

          Big O Notation - the more you understand it and its implications the better off you will be.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you are developing your programs you will come up with a solution, one of which there will probably be many. Depending on the complexity program or portion of the program Big O Notation will be playing a big part on the resources consumed to produce the answer or the result of what you are looking for. This idea of performance matters, it is no different than tuning a car to achieve a maximum power output or efficiency.

        <p>
          The concept of Big O Notation denotes the worst-case scenario or the time requried to execute an algorithm to its completion. Its origins are from mathematics and are very applicable to computer programming.

          An example that is used on the internet is the time to find a string in an array. This is defined as O(1): that is, no matter how long the array is the time to finding that string is linear if it were always found in the last element of the array.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lets up it a notch. Imagine now you had an array of arrays of somewhat equal length. The time to searching the array of arrays has now grown exponentially by 2. In this situation it would be defined as O(N2). The time to find the string in the last element of that array would take 81 iterations if the parent array had 9 elements of arrays of 9 elements each.
        </p>
        <p>
          O(N2) is not the worse situation. What becomes even more performance draining are the O(2N) algorithms. An example of this would be a recursive alogrithm where much like what could be used to print out a sequence of fibonacci numbers. As the input grows recursively, the time to the end grows exponentially each time draining the resources and the performance faster, requiring more power and compute power.

          Why does this matter? Well, we plan on working on some project in our future. We will have to pay for hardware or some cloud engine, the more efficient we can make these programs compute wise, we can save ourselves a lot of money in the long run (or the company we work for). It can be almost guaranteed that recruiters will be wanting to make sure that you know this concept, so its best you figure it out sooner rather than later.
