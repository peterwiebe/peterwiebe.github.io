* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

To create a GitHub repository you need to open a web browser on your computer and navigate to the github.com website. There you must log in or create an account. Once logged in there is a green button that says +New repository. Click on it. Enter in the repository name, add a description if you wish, select the public option, check the box to the right of the "Initialize this repository with a README" change the license by click on the dropdown button to the MIT license. Then click on the Create repository. On the page following there is a HTTPS clone URL to the bottom right of the window. Click on the little clipboard icon to the right of it to copy the link to the computer's memory.
Next open the bash (Terminal on Mac computers). Navigate to the folder where you want to save the files for the project by entering mkdir to create a folder or cd and then the directory where you want to the place files if it is already created. Once in the appropriate directory type in the following command git clone and then paste the link you saved to your computer's memory, hit enter and the repository will be saved to your computer.

* Describe what open source means.

Open source in this context refers to open source software which is software that anyone can download, edit and customize any way they wish.

* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I think that Open Source is mostly good. It enables a vastly larger number of people to work on, make changes, add features to your project. It can help people interested in learning to see what is going on internally. It is a challenge though when you are trying to make a living and people copy your code and sell it as their own. Hopefully, in the business sense, you have a competitive advantage over your competitors so that it doesn't make a difference. The other potential issue for open source software is that there could be potential security risks if the wrong people try determine a way to break your code for bad purposes. The opposide of that coin is that people will make changes to the project and it will be more robust in the end.

* Assess the importance of using licenses.

Using licenses makes it clear who can use your source code, what they can do with it, if the updates need to be brought back to the original code, if others can profit it from. These are all very important factors to think about when you create something. Restricting access or ability to do certain things may require more work for the creator to have to deal with when other individuals or organizations want to use the source code.

* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

As I continue to work on using git to push branches, merge them on github, and pull them back down with git I am becoming much confident that I won't have many problems down the road. Being that I have been mostly familiar with these techniques before there were no real 'aha' moments, just confidence building. Can't really say I really struggled with anything, just need to memorize the commands.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

These are more or less specific to Canada IP rules with a bit of UBC flavor but I am sure there are commonalities to the US
