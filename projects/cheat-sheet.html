    <h1>Cheat-Sheet: Ruby Hashes, Arrays, and Strings</h1>
    <h3>Hashes</h3>
    <pre><code class="ruby">
  hash = Hash.new        # creating a new empty hash
  hash = {}              # does the same as above

  hash["key"] = "value"  # adding a key/value pair with the key being a string "key" and the value being a string "value"
  hash = {"key" => "value"}  # does the same as above

  p hash["key"]  # this will print out the "value" string
  p hash.fetch("key")  # this does the same thing as above
    </code></pre>
    <p>Ruby's hashes are a quasi way of defining your own objects in Ruby (this statement may be a bit confusing because everything in Ruby is an object). This is due to its key --> value pair relationship. The key can be a number, a string, a symbol, and it points to a specific value held in the hash.</p>

    <h3>Arrays</h3>
    <pre><code class="ruby">
  array = Array.new        # creating a new empty array
  array = []              # does the same as above

  array[0] = "value"  # adding a value at index 0 with the value being a string "value"
  array = ["value"]  # does the same as above

  p array[0]  # this will print out the "value" string
  p array.at(0)  # this does the same thing as above
    </code></pre>
    <p>Ruby's arrays are very similar to hashes with one very distinct difference: ruby arrays' keys are in sequential integer order. This is consistent with arrays across pretty much all programming languages but it needs to be highlighted. Iteration over arrays is also a bit less verbose than hashes (I hope to include the differences in the future).</p>

    <h3>Strings</h3>
    <pre><code class="ruby">
  string = String.new        # creating a new empty string
  string = ""              # does the same as above

  string = "hello"  # setting "hello" to the string variable
  string += "hello" # this does the same as above for a blank string but concatenates to the existing str

  p string[0]  # this will print out the "h" character - a string can act like a an array
    </code></pre>
    <p>Strings are another type in Ruby that have similarities to arrays. You can access and iterate over the contents of a string in similar ways as you can in arrays (remember everything is an object), though not in all the same ways. The main purpose though of a string in Ruby is to store text in a variable.</p>
