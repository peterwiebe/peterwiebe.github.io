* **What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margins by doing this challenge?**

I learned that when using % based margins in the position: static don't work for top margins. Also, that the layout of the elements may not be structured as you intended if all the parts add up to 100% when using % based layouts. I didn't really learn much of anything for padding and borders, at least nothing more than I already knew.

* **What did you learn about CSS positioning?**

CSS positioning rarely works as expected. I started to dabble using Flexbox but there is a fair bit to think about when using it.

* **What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?**

The aspects I found most easy were the styling of the fonts and the creating of the navbar. The most challenging was the blog post summary page. Putting the title in the center with the post summaries flowing around it will continue to be a challenge I am sure.

* **What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?**

At this early stage a lot of testing needs to be done to make sure that the page flows as you expect. When you think you have it worked out it seems there is always some sort of issue that makes it slightly off.
